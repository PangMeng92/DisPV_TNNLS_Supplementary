# DisPV_TNNLS_Supplementary

In the supplementary, we provide several images (.gif) in three folders to aid the reviwers to better assess the proposed DisP+V model.

1) Outputs of Generator (G)

We provide "Outputs of G.gif", to illustrate the outputs of the generator G with a trained DisP+V model on CAS-PEAL (disguise) dataset. The figures from left to right are 
Input: enrolment sample, 

Outputs: generated prototype, generated variation, and reconstructed face sample. 

2) Face Editing
 
We provide "FaceEdit_Expression.gif", "FaceEdit_Disguise.gif", "FaceEdit_Pose.gif", "FaceEdit_Light.gif", and "FaceEdit_Multiple", to show more face editing examples on Multi-PIE (expression), CAS-PEAL (disguise), FERET (pose), E-Yale-B&AR Light (illumination), and FRGC v2.0 (multiple variations) datasets, respectively. 

3) Face Interpolation 

We provide "FaceInterpolate_Expression.gif", "FaceInterpolate_Disguise.gif", "FaceInterpolate_Pose.gif", "FaceInterploate_Light.gif", and "FaceInterploate_Multiple.gif", to show more face interpolation examples on Multi-PIE (expression), CAS-PEAL (disguise), FERET (pose), E-Yale-B&AR Light (illumination), and FRGC v2.0 (multiple variations) datasets, respectively.
